# Proposed Vue Project Challenge: Simple Weather App

## Challenge

Create a Vue.js application that fetches weather data from an API and displays it to the user. The application should:

* **Fetch weather data:** Use an API like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherStack to retrieve weather information for a specified location.
* **Display weather information:** Render the fetched data in a clear and concise format, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant details.
* **Handle errors:** Implement error handling to gracefully handle cases where the API request fails.
* **Provide a user-friendly interface:** Design a visually appealing and intuitive interface for the user.
* **Consider responsiveness:** Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.

## Additional Considerations

* **State management:** Explore using Vuex for managing application state, especially if the application grows in complexity.
* **User interaction:** Add features like user input for city search or unit conversion.
* **Styling:** Use CSS or a CSS framework to style the application.

This challenge will help you solidify your understanding of Vue.js fundamentals, API consumption, and basic UI development.
